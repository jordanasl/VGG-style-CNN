The proposed model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It follows a VGG-style architecture, characterized by the use of stacked small (3×3) convolutional kernels, progressive channel expansion, and spatial downsampling via max-pooling.
